These include: American Airlines, Apple Inc Ltd, Alaska Air, Amazon, Bausch Health, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Google, Goldman Sachs, Hawaiian Holdings, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co.

She is supported emotionally by her family and has huge savings from the money sent by parents for daily expense till date

Your task is to provide consultation to this high profile client based on her requirements and financial objectives.

You must use the metrics and the visualizations to compare the performance of the available securities against each other, and also against the market index, S&P500.
The findings should be aligned with the investor persona to select the appropriate stocks for the portfolio. You are expected to validate the same using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) before including the stock in the portfolio.
After the selection of suitable stocks, you must apply a suitable predictive model to estimate the returns from the portfolio at the end of the investment period. You must check if the portfolio has the potential to fulfil the financial goals of the investor

<B> Technical skills needed for this project:

1. Programming is a necessity for any Analytical project. In this case Python was leveraged
2. Key insights derived using Data Science:
  
i) Data Cleaning: Once the historical information was derived from Yahoo Finance for all S&P 500 stocks and index unnecessary columns and missing data had to be dropped as part of Data cleaning
  
ii) Data Visualization: Visualizing the data as-is using box plots, sub-plots, heat maps
  
iii) Data Interpretation / Perform any Calculation: We calculated the Alpha and Volatility of the stocks versus benchmark index (i.e. S&P 500)
  
iv) Data Normalization: Since all stocks are mapped to different scales, we had to normalize them to a scale between 0 and 1 for comparing their performance on a standard scale
  
v) Data clustering: Bucket these stocks based on k-means algorithm
  
vi) Dimension Reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) : Drop those features that are not adding value
